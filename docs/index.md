# Welcome to Showcase Chirpy Easy Docs! üöÄ

This page ‚Äî yes, the one you're looking at right now ‚Äî was generated
_automagically_ using our own GitHub Action: **`showcase-chirpy-easy-docs`**. No
fancy tools, just plain Markdown and a push to your repo ‚ú®.

With this action, you can turn your `docs/` folder into a full-blown
documentation site using the awesome
[Showcase Chirpy Jekyll theme](https://jsurrea.github.io/showcase-chirpy-theme/).
No Jekyll config headaches, no custom deploy scripts ‚Äî just write your `.md`
files and go.

> This exact site was built using this action. You're not just reading the docs
> ‚Äî you're _in_ the docs. {: .prompt-tip }
